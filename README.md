Utility functions for python

The python functions are organized in packages and modules in the subdirectory
`utils`. Unittests reside in subdirectories `tests` in the respective packages.
The top-level folder `tests` provides shell scripts to run all unittests and
determine the test coverage. Finally, the top-level folder `scripts` contains
python code that can be executed as a command directly from the shell.
